# DecentSurvey

## Decentralised Survey/Polling Application


### Preamble

Currently, there is far too much Personal Data[^1] flying around much too freely on the Internet.

It is collected in cookies to be exploited directly, sold, resold, breached and posted publicly.

### Payments

- Start with XRP payments but expand to other crypto assets in later phases
    - both Pollsters and Respondents should be able to pay in the crypto of their choice
    - obviously the app can't accept every shitcoin that exists but i t should go as broad as possible as fast as possible
        - This creates the need for a background asset management app that can (among other functions) manage exchange exposure risk by trading assets in/out as necessary

[^1]: There are various terms used in various jurisdictions:

     - Personal Data is used by GDPR in the EU
     - [Personally Identifiable Information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data) (PII) is common in the US
